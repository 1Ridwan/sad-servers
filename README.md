## In this directory I will be posting all of my solutions to the sadservers game
## I will begin by completing all easy problems
## then i will probably do bandit levels 1-20 again to practice foundations
## i will then return to sad servers and finish all the medium problems
## finally i will do a few hard problems to really test my linux knowledge!
